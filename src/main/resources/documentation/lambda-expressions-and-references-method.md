# Java 8: Lambda Expressions and Method References

## Lambda Expressions

Lambda Expressions in Java provide a clear and concise way to implement interfaces with a single abstract method (functional interfaces). They are a fundamental feature introduced in Java 8, promoting a functional programming approach.

### Syntax
```java
(parameter1, parameter2, ...) -> { statement(s); }
```

### Characteristics
- **Conciseness**: Reduces the boilerplate code.
- **Readability**: Makes the code more readable.
- **Functional Programming**: Enables functional programming by passing behavior as a method argument, returning it from a method, or storing it in a variable.

### Use Cases
- Working with collections and streams.
- Implementing interfaces with a single abstract method (functional interfaces) like `Runnable`, `Callable`, `Comparator`, etc.
- Event handling (e.g., in GUI applications).

## References Method

Method References are a special type of Lambda Expressions in Java. They allow you to refer directly to methods of existing classes or objects.

### Syntax
```java
ClassName::methodName
```

### Types
1. **Reference to a static method**: `ContainingClass::staticMethodName`
2. **Reference to an instance method of a particular object**: `containingObject::instanceMethodName`
3. **Reference to an instance method of an arbitrary object of a particular type**: `ContainingType::methodName`
4. **Reference to a constructor**: `ClassName::new`

### Use Cases
- Referencing methods directly in streams, or wherever functional interfaces are used.
- Making the code more readable and concise.
- Reusing existing methods as Lambda Expressions.

In conclusion, Lambda Expressions and Method References greatly enhance Java's capabilities for functional programming, making it possible to write more concise, readable, and maintainable code.
