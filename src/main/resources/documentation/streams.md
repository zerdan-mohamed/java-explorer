## Java 8 Streams Overview

### Stream Creation
- From collections: `Collection.stream()`
- From arrays: `Arrays.stream(array)`
- Using `Stream.of()`
- From values: `Stream.of(val1, val2, val3)`
- Infinite streams: `Stream.iterate()` and `Stream.generate()`
- Primitive streams: `IntStream.range()`, `LongStream.rangeClosed()`

### Intermediate Operations
- `map`: Transforms each element.
- `filter`: Filters elements based on a condition.
- `flatMap`: Flattens nested structures.
- `distinct`: Removes duplicate elements.
- `sorted`: Sorts the stream.
- `peek`: Performs an action without changing the stream.
- `limit`: Limits the number of elements.
- `skip`: Skips a certain number of elements.

### Terminal Operations
- `forEach`: Iterates over each element.
- `collect`: Collects elements into a collection.
- `count`: Counts the number of elements.
- `reduce`: Reduces the elements to a single value.
- `anyMatch`, `allMatch`, `noneMatch`: Matching operations.
- `findFirst`, `findAny`: Finding elements.
- `toArray`: Converts the stream to an array.


## Additional Use Cases and Examples

### Sorting
- Natural and custom ordering using `sorted()`.

### Reduction
- Sum, min, max, average, string concatenation.

### Collecting
- To list, set, map.
- Custom collectors using `Collectors`.

### FlatMap
- Flatten nested lists into a single list.

### Parallel Streams
- Parallel processing for performance improvement.

### Grouping and Partitioning
- Using `Collectors.groupingBy()` and `Collectors.partitioningBy()`.

### Mapping
- Transforming data with `map()` and `flatMap()`.

Each operation and use case provides a unique aspect of the Stream API, showcasing the versatility and power of streams in Java 8. This guide covers a broad range of functionalities but remember to explore and practice to master streams effectively.



Each section of the example demonstrates different aspects of the Stream API:

- **Creation**: Shows different ways to create streams.
- **Intermediate Operations**: These operations transform the stream into another one, like `map` and `filter`.
- **Terminal Operations**: These operations produce a result or side-effect, like `forEach`, `count`, and `max`.
- **Additional Examples**: Demonstrates more complex uses like sorting, reducing, mapping to a data structure, flattening nested structures, and utilizing parallel processing.

Remember, this is still not exhaustive of all Stream functionalities but should give you a solid understanding of the versatility of Java 8 Streams. You can experiment with these examples and modify them to explore further.
